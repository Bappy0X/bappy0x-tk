                        Hello, my name's Josh. This website is what I like to call my `Diary of Software and Web Development`. Here you can find various things, including some of my projects, 
                        what languages I specialise in and you can even watch some of my content on some of these languages!<br>If you would like to know about me... Well, I'm a British 16 
                        year old student. I study A-Level Computer Science, BTEC Public Service, A-Level Mathematics and more. My main interests revolve around firefighting and this is the 
                        industry I'd love to work in - primarily as a firefighter. I'm working towards this goal as I progress through my Cadet firefighting course as well as my Public Service 
                        course. However, I also have a vast amount of knowledge in Software and Web Development, and I'd like to keep it as a hobby for as long as possible.<br>When it comes to 
                        programming and coding, I typically like to help people and experiment with my own projects at both high and low levels. Web Development is my largest strength and I love 
                        to build different web applications, whether that be a joke generator or an advanced, fully-fledged site that uses encrypted user logins and more.

                        I create tutorials for beginners, however these tutorials are designed so that anybody from any skillset or background can follow them. I decided to make these 
                        tutorials because so many people ask me, daily, `How do I code?`, `Where should I start?`, `How do I start?`. Complaints against currently existing tutorials are also 
                        common, as people find them boring, counterintuitive and otherwise hard to follow. My tutorials aim to help new people, rather than confuse them.<br>As well as this, 
                        I use the service <a href="" target="_blank">Fiverr</a> in order to offer some not-so-free services, but I aim to make 
                        these as cheap and as reasonable as possible, and stretch for the buyer to learn the language that I write for them, and encourage them to watch some of my 
                        easy-to-follow tutorials.<br> I also have a keen interest in music and I'm quite an audiophile. I play guitar and write lyrics and tracks when I have nothing better to 
                        do. Along with this, I also greatly appreciate photography. I studied GCSE Photography and I'm obsessed with framing and creating the right picture for what it's meant 
                        for. I've captured airshows, different landscapes, different portraits and of course; I've photographed my counties Fire Service.<br>Naturally, along with my Computer 
                        Science studies and my general interest in computing, I love computer hardware. I constantly look for the best deals on different components and keep my eye on new 
                        products within the tech industry.<br>As I mentioned above, I also like to `play around` and create my own applications purely for fun. This allows for me to learn, 
                        therefore enabling me to educate and tell other people about my findings. I've created successful Discord bots, successful Roblox games, multiple web apps (including 
                        RESTful API's) and much, much more.

                        All of the services that I offer, regardless if they're free to code or not, come at a cost. There are many services that must be used in order to launch an application 
                        and therefore a cost of some form is inflicted. I don't currently work and because of my dedication to my studies, I am unable to. So, the cost of the services that I 
                        use, like <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com" target="_blank"><abbr title="Used for VPS hosting">DigitalOcean</abbr></a> and

                        I have multiple goals, not only in the field of coding. However, atleast half of my life aspirations lay within coding. Firstly, I'd like to reach a wide audience. This 
                        will allow me to help more people, also adding more people into the industry. I use LBRY as my main platform for uploading my content. This platform rewards viewers for 
                        watching content with LBC (a cryptocurrency) and this is used in order to promote content. Therefore, I need LBC in order to succeed on this platform, and viewing is 
                        completely free to you.

                        Outside of coding/computing; I aim to finish my A-Level and Fire Cadet courses. Once I've completed these, I then aim to join the Fire Service to serve the public and 
                        the entire country - for as long as I possibly can. I'd like to continue coding and when I get the time, then that'll be what I'm most likely doing.

                        There are many different routes and pathways to coding, and there are so many different ways to start too. Here are a small list of some of the ways you can start, 
                        ordered from easiest, to hardest:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <a href="https://register.ubisoft.com/rabbids-coding/en-GB" target="_blank">Rabbids Coding</a>
                            <p>
                                Rabbids Coding is all about learning through play. You can place blocks of code down, in order to instruct `Rabbids` on where to go, what to do. This will 
                                introduce you to some basic fundamentals within coding. Including loops, conditions and optimisation.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Scratch</a>
                            <p>
                                Scratch is a lot like Rabbids Coding, however it will introduce you to a lot more, and in a slightly more advanced way. Scratch uses `drag and drop` blocks of 
                                code. It can in order to create mini-games and mini applications Scratch can also run in the browser, so no downloads are needed at all. For those who already 
                                know languages like JavaScript, custom code blocks can be made - there are some interesting videos online demonstrating this.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Roblox is a great starting place for anybody that is interested in multiplayer interaction. Roblox is not as a simple as Rabbids Coding, nor Scratch. However, 
                                its unique take on LUA helps for a simple and intuitive start. Roblox is also very well documented, allowing you to search up any issues that you may be having.
                                Roblox's games are all built by their players, this allows anybody to play and create their own custom worlds and there are very many different genres of games 
                                to play. It's certainly a great starting point - but I recommend having atleast a little bit of prior knowledge if you choose to code on it.

                                Python is also one of the greatest places to start. It introduces proper programming syntax and other fundamental/core structures for nearly every language that 
                                exists. It also allows its users to use packages that other users built. This allows for an absolutely gigantic amount of functionality, allowing users to do 
                                do (quite literally) whatever they'd like to do. This could be; build a game, create a 3d engine, analyse and scan images and infinitely more.
