                        Hello, my name's Josh. This website is what I like to call my `Diary of Software and Web Development`. Here you can find various things, including some of my projects, 
                        what languages I specialise in and you can even find some useful content on some of these languages!<br>If you would like to know about me... Well, I'm a student living in
                        Cheshire, England. I'm currently studying A-Level Computer Science, A-Level Business Studies and BTEC Level 3 Public Services. Some of my interests revolve around firefighting 
                        - this being the end-goal of my life, to work and serve as a firefighter. I am currently working towards this goal alongside my studies. I have a vast amount of knowledge in 
                        Software and Web Development, and I'd like to keep it as a hobby for as long as possible.<br>In the field of programming and coding, I typically like to assist people and 
                        experiment with my own projects at both high and low levels. Web Development is my largest strength and I love to build different web applications, whether that be a joke 
                        generator or an advanced, fully-fledged site that uses encrypted user logins and more.<br>I have over a decades experience working with computers and I've been progrmaming 
                        for over 7 years! I still own my first computer; an AMD powered Lenovo all-in-one, the glorified calculator that powered the name that I still uphold to this day within the 
                        tech industry.

                <div class="col-md-8">
                    <p>
                        I do a lot of client-based work for a vast variety of customers from many different backgrounds and levels of experience. I also love to assist and help people with their 
                        projects. In doing this, I teach people how to code. I'm commonly asked; `How do I code`, `Where should I start?` and `How do I start?` and complaints are very common with the 
                        current field of tutorials and teaching - I aim to answer these questions and try my best to change this, and to assist people to the very best of my ability.<br>I also have a 
                        keen interest in music and I'm quite an audiophile. I play guitar and write lyrics and tracks when in the little time I have spare. Along with this, I also greatly appreciate 
                        photography. I studied GCSE Photography and I'm obsessed with framing and creating the right picture to fit its purpose. I've captured airshows, different landscapes, 
                        different portraits and of course; I've photographed my counties Fire Service.<br>Naturally, along with my Computer Science studies and my massive interest in computing, 
                        I love computer hardware. I constantly look for the best deals on different components and keep my eye out for new releases within the tech industry.<br>I also love to `play 
                        around`, creating my own applications purely for fun. This allows for me to learn, therefore enabling me to educate and tell other people about my findings. I've created 
                        successful Discord bots, successful games, multiple web apps (including RESTful API's) and much, much more.

                        More often than not, the services that I use in order to deploy and maintain code, come at a cost. I don't currently hold a job and because of my dedication to my studies, this is 
                        quite difficult. So, the cost of the services that I use, like <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com" target="_blank"><abbr title="Used for VPS hosting">DigitalOcean</abbr></a> and 
                        <a href="https://www.namecheap.com" target="_blank"><abbr title="Used for domain registration">Namecheap</abbr></a> as well as many more, must be covered.

                        I have multiple goals, not only in the field of coding. However, atleast half of my life aspirations lay within computing. Firstly, I'd like to reach a help and assist more people. 
                        Passing down my knowledge feels extremely rewarding, and enabling people to become independant in creating their projects feels like a high.<br>Outside of coding/computing; I aim 
                        to finish my A-Level and Firefighting courses. Once I've completed these, I then aim to join the Fire Service to serve the public and the entire country - for as long as I possibly 
                        can. I'd like to continue coding and when I get the time, then that'll be what I'm most likely doing.

                        There are many different routes and pathways to coding, and there are so many different ways to start too. Here are a small list of some of the ways you can start, 
                        ordered from easiest, to hardest:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <a href="https://register.ubisoft.com/rabbids-coding/en-GB" target="_blank">Rabbids Coding</a>
                            <p>
                                Rabbids Coding is all about learning through play. You can place blocks of code down, in order to instruct `Rabbids` on where to go, what to do. This will 
                                introduce you to some basic fundamentals within coding. Including loops, conditions and optimisation.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Scratch</a>
                            <p>
                                Scratch is a lot like Rabbids Coding, however it will introduce you to a lot more, and in a slightly more advanced way. Scratch uses `drag and drop` blocks of 
                                code. It can in order to create mini-games and mini applications Scratch can also run in the browser, so no downloads are needed at all. For those who already 
                                know languages like JavaScript, custom code blocks can be made - there are some interesting videos online demonstrating this.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                            <a href="https://www.roblox.com/" target="_blank">Roblox</a>
                            <p>
                                Roblox is a great starting place for anybody that is interested in multiplayer interaction. Roblox is not as a simple as Rabbids Coding, nor Scratch. However, 
                                its unique take on LUA helps for a simple and intuitive start. Roblox is also very well documented, allowing you to search up any issues that you may be having.
                                Roblox's games are all built by their players, this allows anybody to play and create their own custom worlds and there are very many different genres of games 
                                to play. It's certainly a great starting point - but I recommend having atleast a little bit of prior knowledge if you choose to code on it.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                            <p>
                                Python is also one of the greatest places to start. It introduces proper programming syntax and other fundamental/core structures for nearly every language that 
                                exists. It also allows its users to use packages that other users built. This allows for an absolutely gigantic amount of functionality, allowing users to do 
                                do (quite literally) whatever they'd like to do. This could be; build a game, create a 3d engine, analyse and scan images and infinitely more.
